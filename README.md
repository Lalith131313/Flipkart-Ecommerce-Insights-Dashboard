# Flipkart Ecommerce Insights Dashboard

## 📘 Overview
This project began as a raw CSV file filled with thousands of Flipkart e-commerce transactions.  
The goal? Transform messy retail data into a clean, interactive, decision-ready Power BI dashboard.

What started as a simple data file evolved into a multi-page analytics experience revealing trends, performance metrics, customer behavior, and product insights that could help any business sharpen its strategy.

## 📂 Dataset Story
The dataset included:

- Order IDs  
- Product categories  
- Brands  
- Selling prices & marked prices  
- Ratings & reviews  
- Item description  
- Return status  
- Seller & location details  

The raw CSV needed heavy cleanup before it could tell a meaningful story.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)
Before Power BI ever saw the data, I performed several preparation steps in Excel:

- Removed missing values and duplicates  
- Standardized category names  
- Fixed inconsistent formatting  
- Cleaned text columns  
- Converted price fields to numeric formats  
- Extracted new fields where needed  

This ensured a smooth import into Power BI.

## 📊 Power BI Workflow
Once the dataset was ready, I imported it into Power BI and performed:

### **🔧 Data Modeling**
- Created relationships between tables  
- Added calculated columns  
- Built DAX measures for:
  - Total Sales  
  - Profit Margin  
  - Average Ratings  
  - Return Percentage  

### **📈 Visualizations Included**
The dashboard was structured into multiple pages:

1. **Sales Overview**
   - Revenue trend line  
   - Top-selling categories  
   - KPI cards for quick insights  

2. **Product & Brand Performance**
   - Best-performing brands  
   - High-return products  
   - Ratings breakdown  

3. **Customer & Region Insights**
   - Geo-map for region-wise sales  
   - Customer behavior analysis  
   - Category preferences  

4. **Returns & Delivery Metrics**

These insights can help optimize pricing, forecast demand, and improve customer satisfaction.
